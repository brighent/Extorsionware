# Extorsionware
Our framework exploits vulnerabilities in currently deployed smart contracts to demand for a ransom.
The code in this directory is related to the paper "Extorsionware: Exploiting Smart Contract Vulnerabilities for Fun and Profit" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.09843.pdf).
We provide the showcase implementation of different implementations of the Extorsionware attack, based on the vulnearbility that affects the victim Smart Contract.
